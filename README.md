Project Overview:
The NYC Citi Bike Rental Analysis aims to uncover key insights into bike-sharing usage patterns, helping us understand:
Which locations have the highest rental activity?
How trip duration varies across different age groups?
Which age groups rent the most bikes?
How rental patterns differ between one-time users and long-term subscribers?

Data & Tools Used:
Data Source
The dataset consists of real-world Citi Bike trip data from New York City.
Contains details like trip duration, user type, age group, and rental locations.
Data Cleaning & Processing was performed using Google Sheets & Excel.

Tools & Techniques:
Google Sheets & Excel ‚Äì Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting
Power BI (if applicable) ‚Äì Interactive Dashboards & Visualizations
Descriptive Statistics ‚Äì Finding trends, averages, and comparisons

Questions Answered & Key Insights :
1. What are the most popular pick-up locations across NYC?
Insight: The top 20 most used pick-up stations are concentrated in high-traffic areas, such as business districts, tourist spots, and public transit hubs.
Recommendation: Increase bike availability in high-demand locations during peak hours.

2Ô∏è. How does the average trip duration vary across different age groups?
Insight: Young riders (18-24) take longer trips (12 mins), likely for leisure or exploration.
Middle-aged groups (25-64) have stable trip durations (7-9 mins), indicating structured commuting.
Older users (75+) have the longest trips (49 mins), suggesting a slower riding pace or sightseeing.
Recommendation:
Offer student discounts for younger users.
Introduce senior-friendly bikes & guided rides for 75+ age group.

3Ô∏è. Which age group rents the most bikes?
Insight: 35-44 age group has the highest rentals (7,697 trips), likely due to commuting needs.

Create discounts & targeted campaigns for younger and senior users to increase ridership.

4Ô∏è. How do bike rentals vary between one-time users vs. long-term subscribers?
Insight: Subscribers rent bikes more on weekdays, suggesting daily commuters.
One-time users rent more on weekends, likely for leisure and tourism.
Recommendation: Launch weekday promotions for casual users.
Enhance weekend availability in tourist-heavy areas.

Visualizations & Dashboard
To make the findings interactive, I created data visualizations in Google Sheets:
Heatmaps of top pick-up locations üìç
Bar charts comparing trip duration by age ‚è≥
User type rental trends over weekdays/weekends üìÜ

üìë Conclusion & Business Recommendations
Based on this analysis, Citi Bike can implement the following:
  Improve bike availability in top rental zones.
  Offer promotions & discounts for underrepresented age groups.
